          At MySpace, we understand the importance of your privacy. This Privacy Policy details how we collect, utilize, maintain, and disclose information gathered from users of our platform. We encourage you to read this policy thoroughly to understand our practices regarding your data.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">Our Operational Context and Data Safety Disclaimer</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          It's crucial to understand that MySpace is currently operating as a <b>developmental platform specifically for the education and training of students under the direct guidance of THE BOSS</b>. This means its primary purpose is pedagogical, focusing on coding, project management, and collaborative learning exercises.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 font-bold text-red-700 dark:text-red-400">
          <b>Please Note: Data Security for Training Environment</b>
          <br />
          Due to its present status as a teaching and training tool, MySpace's data security protocols are commensurate with a learning environment rather than a fully production-grade application. Consequently, we must explicitly state that <b>the absolute safety and confidentiality of user data cannot be guaranteed at this time</b>. We strongly advise against uploading highly sensitive, proprietary, or personal information that, if compromised, could lead to significant harm or privacy breaches. This limitation will remain in effect until MySpace transitions from its educational role and receives formal notification of enhanced security measures.
